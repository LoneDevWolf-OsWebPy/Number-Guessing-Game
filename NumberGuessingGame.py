#                           Algorithm for Creating a Number Guessing Game and How it works
# ======================================================================================================================
# 1. User inputs he lower bound and upper bound of the range.
# 2. The compiler generates a random integer between the range and store it in a variable for future references.
# 3. For repetitive guessing, a while loop will be initialized.
# 4. If the user guessed a number which is greater than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output "Try Again!
#    Your guess is too high"
# 5. Else if the user guessed a number which is smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output
#    "Try Again! You guessed too small"
# 6. And if the user guessed in a minimum number of guesses, the user get "Congratulations!" output
# 7. Else if the user didn't guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will get a better luck next time
#    output.
